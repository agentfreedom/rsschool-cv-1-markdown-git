### Summary

_Time and attention to detail are the keys to solving problems of any complexity, and I have these keys. I'm a fan of web development technologies. I study and practice the acquired knowledge in my own small projects. I am looking for a team of mentors to gain commercial development experience. If you have an open vacancy for an intern or a junior web developer, I would be glad to receive your suggestions. I am ready to benefit your company. I am ready to quickly master the internal rules, instructions, and a set of technologies to bring profit to your company._
